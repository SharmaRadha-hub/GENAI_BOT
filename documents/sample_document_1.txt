Welcome to the RAG Knowledge Base System

Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
=====================================================

What is RAG?
------------
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI technique that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval systems. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on their training data, RAG systems can access and reference specific, up-to-date information from custom knowledge bases.

Key Components of RAG:
----------------------
1. Document Ingestion: The process of loading and preparing documents for the knowledge base
2. Text Chunking: Breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces
3. Embeddings: Converting text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning
4. Vector Database: Storing and indexing embeddings for fast similarity search
5. Retrieval: Finding the most relevant information based on user queries
6. Generation: Using an LLM to synthesize retrieved information into coherent answers

Benefits of RAG:
---------------
- Access to Private Data: Enable LLMs to answer questions about your specific documents
- Real-time Updates: Add new information without retraining the entire model
- Source Attribution: Track where information comes from for better transparency
- Cost-Effective: Avoid expensive model fine-tuning while maintaining high accuracy
- Reduced Hallucinations: Ground responses in actual document content

Common Use Cases:
----------------
- Internal company documentation Q&A systems
- Technical support chatbots with product-specific knowledge
- Academic research assistants
- Legal document analysis
- Customer service automation with company-specific policies

Technical Architecture:
----------------------
The RAG pipeline typically follows these steps:
1. User submits a question
2. Question is converted to an embedding vector
3. Vector database performs similarity search
4. Most relevant document chunks are retrieved
5. Retrieved context is combined with the question
6. LLM generates a comprehensive answer based on the context
7. Answer is returned to the user with source citations

Best Practices:
--------------
- Use appropriate chunk sizes (typically 300-1000 characters)
- Include overlap between chunks to preserve context
- Choose the right embedding model for your domain
- Tune the number of retrieved documents (k) for optimal results
- Regularly update the knowledge base with new information
- Monitor and evaluate system performance with real queries
