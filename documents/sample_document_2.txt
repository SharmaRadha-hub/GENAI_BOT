Vector Databases and Embeddings in RAG Systems

Understanding Vector Databases
==============================

What are Vector Databases?
--------------------------
Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to efficiently store, index, and search high-dimensional vector embeddings. Unlike traditional databases that work with structured data like numbers and strings, vector databases excel at finding similar items based on semantic meaning.

Popular Vector Databases:
------------------------
1. ChromaDB: Lightweight, open-source, easy to integrate
2. Pinecone: Managed cloud service with excellent scalability
3. FAISS: Facebook's efficient similarity search library
4. Weaviate: Open-source with built-in vectorization
5. Milvus: Highly scalable for production deployments
6. Qdrant: Written in Rust, known for performance

Embedding Models
===============

What are Embeddings?
-------------------
Embeddings are dense vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Words or sentences with similar meanings have embeddings that are close together in vector space, even if they use different words.

Popular Embedding Models:
------------------------
- sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Fast and efficient, good for general use
- sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2: Higher quality, slightly slower
- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002: Commercial, high quality
- Cohere embed-english-v3.0: Strong performance, commercial
- Google Universal Sentence Encoder: Good multilingual support

Choosing the Right Model:
-------------------------
Factors to consider:
- Domain specificity: General vs. domain-specific models
- Speed vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Model size and resource requirements
- Language support
- Cost (for commercial models)
- Dimensionality of the output vectors

Similarity Search Methods
========================

Distance Metrics:
----------------
1. Cosine Similarity: Measures angle between vectors (most common)
2. Euclidean Distance: Straight-line distance in vector space
3. Dot Product: Direct vector multiplication
4. Manhattan Distance: Sum of absolute differences

Index Types:
-----------
- Flat Index: Exact search, slower but accurate
- HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): Fast approximate search
- IVF (Inverted File): Partitions space for faster search
- LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing): Probabilistic similarity

Performance Optimization
=======================

Chunking Strategies:
-------------------
- Fixed-size chunking: Simple, consistent sizes
- Sentence-based chunking: Preserve semantic boundaries
- Paragraph-based chunking: Maintain logical structure
- Sliding window: Overlap for context preservation
- Semantic chunking: Break at topic boundaries

Retrieval Optimization:
----------------------
- Adjust top-k parameter based on use case
- Use metadata filtering to narrow search
- Implement re-ranking for better precision
- Cache frequently accessed embeddings
- Batch processing for multiple queries
- Monitor and log query performance

Embedding Cache Strategies:
--------------------------
- Cache document embeddings to avoid recomputation
- Use disk persistence for vector stores
- Implement incremental updates for new documents
- Regular cleanup of unused embeddings

Quality Assurance:
-----------------
- Test retrieval quality with sample queries
- Measure precision and recall metrics
- Monitor relevance scores
- Collect user feedback on answer quality
- A/B test different chunk sizes and k values

Advanced Techniques:
-------------------
- Hybrid search: Combine keyword and semantic search
- Multi-vector retrieval: Use multiple embeddings per document
- Query expansion: Augment queries with related terms
- Re-ranking: Apply additional scoring after initial retrieval
- Metadata filtering: Pre-filter based on document attributes
